class PublishFilesPlugin(HookBaseClass):
    """
    Plugin for creating generic publishes in Shotgun.

    This plugin is typically configured to act upon files that are dragged and
    dropped into the publisher UI. It can also be used as a base class for
    other file-based publish plugins as it contains standard operations for
    validating and registering publishes with Shotgun.

    Once attached to a publish item, the plugin will key off of properties that
    drive how the item is published.

    The ``path`` property, set on the item, is the only required property as it
    informs the plugin where the file to publish lives on disk.

    The following properties can be set on the item via the collector or by
    subclasses prior to calling methods on the base class::

        ``path`` - The path to the file to be published.

        ``sequence_paths`` - If set, implies the "path" property represents a
            sequence of files (typically using a frame identifier such as %04d).
            This property should be a list of files on disk matching the "path".

        ``is_sequence`` - A boolean defining whether or not this item is a sequence of files.

    The following properties can also be set by a subclass of this plugin via
    :meth:`Item.properties` or :meth:`Item.local_properties`.

        publish_type - Shotgun PublishedFile instance type.

        publish_name - Shotgun PublishedFile instance name.

        publish_version - Shotgun PublishedFile instance version.

        publish_path - The location on disk the publish is copied to.

        sg_publish_data - The dictionary of publish information returned from
            the tk-core register_publish method.
